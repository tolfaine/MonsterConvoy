You know, monsters, I don’t hate you, I just can’t help it. I get mad so quickly.
Sorry if I seem strange, but I swear, it’s just because I have trouble dealing with my emotions.
Still don’t know why I’m doing this… It’s making me feel so sad right now…
Also I find you scary! I’m scared… I’m so troubled, it seems I’m feeling fear, sadness, joy and anger at the same time…
I wish I was less emotional, like you guys…
Maybe it’s hormones. You know, puberty and stuff. I used to like puberty but now it’s making me so angry!
Oh come on, leave me alone! Don’t you have better stuff to do than losing your time with me?
Cause people are always losing time with me… I wanna cry…
“Leave me here, please… Also I like you a lot, you know? Maybe it’s just puberty-talk but still. Do you monsters have puberty?
