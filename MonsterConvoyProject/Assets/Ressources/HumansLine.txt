-------- Normal Talk ---------
Would you dance for a gold coin ?
My cousin told me monsters sounds funny but that's even better than what I expected
The weather is rather nice, we could make a huge amount of gold bringing tourist here
You really are a cute one, I would gladly adopt one of your many children
Do you have time to talk about our lord and savior ?
Uuh ? You were talking ? Could you make an effort and speak human ...

-------- Reussite Attaque  ---------
Gnagnagna, gnagnagna...
I'm gonna crush your skull even though I'm not even sure you have one!
I don't understand this jibber jabber of yours, doomed creature! You're only spitting your disgusting saliva all over my very expensive outfit, which is actually pretty annoying.
I wish you were dead already, but it would be a shame because I wouldn't be able to kill you myself. Such a dilemma.
I hate you monsters! I wish there was not so many of you on the Monster World!
You're so ugly cutting your head off would be a favor to every creature with eyes!

-------- Echec Attaque  ---------
I slipt on a shoelace and it wasn't even mine!
I don't hear you nananananana I stucked my fingers in my ears!
Your head should be banned, that clearly is a cheat. How could i focus on my attack ?!
You're so talkative it's distracting me, hideous creature!
I can fail one attack a million time ... a million attack one time ... wait 
Nooo, you're lying, I didn't miss, you obviously are supporting the monsters.

--------  Fuite  ---------
I want to go back to Kansas, Toto!
It is so hard to run dressed like this!
RNG is against us!
Let's farm more experience points then try again, pals!
The slower runner should sacrifice himself and that is not gonna be me!
Please guys, let's pretend it was raining and I didn't pee my pants!
