-------- Normal Talk ---------
Are you here for the holidays ?
Do you want to take a walk on the wild side ?
We are pleased to welcome you ... pink thingy 
Right behind you, you can see the mighty moutain of Gzül the mighty, he is the nicest Unicorn I have ever met, on your left, beyond the trees is my brother in law swamp, a really kind Kappa, he make the best cucumber soup you have ever taste. Also if you keep heading west you will find a charming little mushroom town, my granny live there she really is one of a kind, always a funny word ... last time she told me she came across a rock and said goodmorning ... it was already 2 in the afternoon ! 
Hi there! I've never seen you around here. First time?
I sooooo love that outfit of yours. You are a person of sure taste, I can say.

-------- Reussite Fear ---------
You better be scared, human, for I'm gonna kick your butt even if I don't have feet!
I expect you to spoil your pants when I'm around, so do it now before I get angry at you!
I'm gonna eat you, your sons, their sons, your parents, and every pink thing I'll find wearing your name until I'm sure nothing close to you ever sees the sunlight again. Plus you're ugly. 
The God of Hell Fire is going to unleash flames on you so each and every of your farts til now will burn your butt skin like bacon!
I will twist your nipples so hard it's gonna look like a pig tail for a thousand year at least.
I will remove your eye globes then put it on a stick, fry it, then fry it a second time, then eat it, then throw it up, then fry it again and make you swallow it and yell a thousand times how pleasant it was. Hope your stomach is as sharp as my toothpicks.

-------- Fail Fear ---------
I may not be as scary as a Kojima version of Silent Hill, but I am pretty sure I'm in the top 3 of the scariest things you have ever seen, so please, be frightened.
I'm going to eat your face and not enjoy it because I'm vegetarian but do it anyway so you'll suffer a lot!
Look at how scary I am! I am scary! I am sooooo scary! I am so scary you're scared! 
I wish I could smell you have cold sweats - not that I am some kind of sweatty armpits fetichist, eh, that would be digusting. What I am trying to say is that I really really want you to be all sweaty and - oh, come on, I don't know how to say it without sounding fucked up. I quit.
Boo !
I will devour your soul, and you will never see it again! Wait, no, I guess you never saw it anyway. I will devour ssomething else, then, something that you already have seen so you'll be able to remark it is missing afterwards.

-------- Reussite Attaque ---------
You didn't see THAT coming with your ridiculous one-pixel eyes, eh?
You don't want to know what is happening next
Take that, you soft pinky thing!
I'll be the meteorite to your dinosaur, stupid big creature!
No sword needed to split your butt in pieces!
I'll kill you, I'll kill you, I'll kill you, I'll kill you, I'll kill you, I'LL KILL YOU!!!
