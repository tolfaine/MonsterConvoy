Monster World is under human invasion since they opened that Magic Portal over there. We need to seal it before they begin to build castles, motels and supermarkets all over our beautiful countrysides. Still, they’re already everywhere or almost, so be ready to meet a lot of these strange pink things during our quest.

I’m writing this down in my grimoire. You can check it while you’re on the world map, just click on the icon on the upper left corner of the screen - you know that stuff, right? That’s a great tip! Humans with *cheveux*  like to talk with monsters with  *mutation*!
As I told you before, humans are invading our world - the mission and stuff, you know. After each fight you can see the points they invaded. They put flags on them, which is in pretty bad taste in my opinion. Anyway, if the Monster World Capital is invaded, our mission is a failure. And you too. 
Now you get to choose which way we’re going. Each destination is different but for now just pick randomly. Don’t worry about getting lost, we have a map!

Oh well, too late. I think it’s the Monster World Capital burning to the ground just behind us. We may have been a bit slow on this one. I guess I’ll have to use my magic powers… How does it work again…? Ok, fine. Time travel, bipidiboum.

Aaaaaand we’re back. Mutated monsters should buy us some time and slow down the human invasion. Let’s try again. But I’m getting tired, so I may nap from now on. Please hurry and stuff.
