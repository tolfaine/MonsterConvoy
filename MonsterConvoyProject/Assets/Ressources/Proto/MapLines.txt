Monster World is under human invasion since they opened that Magic Portal over there. We need to seal it before they begin to build castles, motels and supermarkets all over our beautiful countrysides. Still, they’re already everywhere or so ; be ready to meet a lot of these strange pink things during our quest.

I’m writing this down on my grimoire. You can check it while you’re on the world map, just click on the icon - you know that stuff, right? That’s a great tip! *cheveux* humans like to talk with monsters with *mutation*!

As I told you before, humans are invading our world - the mission and stuff, you know. And after each fight, you can see the points they took. They put flags on it, which is of pretty bad taste in my opinion. Anyway, if the Monster World Capital is invaded, our mission is a failure. And you too. 
Now you get to choose which way we’re going. Each destination is different but for now on, just pick randomly. We might get lost but don’t call me a wanderer!

Oh well, too late. I think it’s the Monster World Capital burning to the ground just behind us. We may have been a bit slow on this one. I guess I’ll have to use my magic powers… How does it work again…? Ok, fine. Time travel, bipidiboum.

Aaaaaand we’re back. Mutated monsters should buy us some time and slow down the human invasion. Let’s try again. But I’m getting tired, so I may nap from now on. Please hurry and stuff.
