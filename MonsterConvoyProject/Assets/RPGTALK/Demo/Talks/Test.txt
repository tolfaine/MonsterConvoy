Oh, sorry, I slimed a bit on your bath towel...
Well, you jellyfish better clean that shit up. Thanks a lot !
Robert is not a jellyfish, he is a slime. It’s quite a common form of monsters over here. And you probably don’t know it, but he used to work as a laundryman, so he sure would know how to handle this red stain.           .        .         .       .     .         .            .                 .
Come on, cry-baby, we don’t give a shit about the jelly’s curriculum! We’re gonna kick the crap out of you!
That’s not very nice of you, you, you… Human-head!
OMG, tentacles! I can’t touch this, it’s so chewy!
Ok you ugly pink thing! Stop being this rude or I will tentacle you LIKE YOU’VE NEVER BEEN TENTACLED BEFORE!

Nooo, not again :’("
